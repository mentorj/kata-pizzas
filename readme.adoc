# Kata Pizzas
:author:jerome@javaxpert.com

## Kata goal

We want to setup basic billing system for an online  pizzas company.
We 'll deal with orders ,where customers can buy :

* drinks & icea creams
* pizzas of course

Pizzas have quite complex pricing rules because price is computed using :

* size (from small to XL )
* pate used ( default or crunchy or large)
* ingredients used ( 3 allowed in standard, 1 euro more per extra choice)
* cooking (calzone adds 2 euros upon standard price)

### Coupons

Billing system must enable customers to use different coupons:

* per order entry : -15% usable on any ice cream or 2 euros rebate for Coca giant bottles
* per order : -10% discount for a whole order or 5 EUROS rebate for an entire order


## Solution proposal

This is a veru basic partial solution:

* working one but do not cover all required entities (Small & medium pizzas but no large/XL format)
* decorator pattern used enables us to create stupid combos (Standard Pizza based on Large Pizzas) because of a lack of checks
* design too technical and not enough domain oriented

So different refactorings may be needed :

* introduce a real OrderEntry entity
* simplify reduce usage for computing the total for an order
* unify discounts management
* makes Pizza building more robust (add consistency checks)
